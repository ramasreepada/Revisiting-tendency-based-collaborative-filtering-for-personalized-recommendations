In this paper, we compute item tendency in two different aspects. In the first aspect, we use an information theoretic approach 
to discover the most unambiguous users and utilize their ratings to compute the item tendency. In the second aspect, we compute the
item tendency with respect to the active user, thereby making the tendency personalized to the users. Finally, we propose to obtain 
stable neighbor sets for each active user, thus making the recommendations more appropriate and accurate. Real-world datasets 
(Yahoo! Music, Netflix and MovieLens) are used to evaluate our approach. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques 
outperform the tendency based approach and traditional CF approaches across standard performance metrics.
